The name of this application is Shopping List. As the name says it all,
this application allows users to create new shopping lists and add items
to the active lists. Items when collected can be marked, and when all items
in a shopping list have been collected, the list can be deactivated so that
it no longer appears in the lists.

The application has been deployed on https://shopping-list-8w2e.onrender.com,
but there is some problem right now so let see if I can manage to deploy it.

For the users who have Docker and want to use the application locally, you can
open the full folder and type into terminal `docker-compose up`.
